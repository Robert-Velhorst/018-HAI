# Verification evidence — honest health, readiness, and boot

This document is a historical verification record for the health-readiness work
that was later merged into `main`. It records exactly what was run and what
happened on the dated host below. It is not a claim that the current branch has
the same package count, connector catalog, or external-service configuration.
Current release evidence comes from the CI jobs and operator checks documented
in `docs/operator-runbook.md`.

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Host: Linux 6.8, Docker 29.1.3, Docker Compose 2.40.3
- Stack file: `docker-compose.local.yml` with `--env-file .env.local`
- Go build/test run in `golang:1.23` container (no Go toolchain on host)

> Historical note: at the time of this verification,
> `docker-compose.local.yml` was the only source-built stack and
> `docker-compose.yml` still pulled prebuilt upstream `jacksonbarreto/*` images.
> The latter was subsequently replaced with a compatibility wrapper around the
> maintained local stack. `docker compose up` and the explicit local-file form
> now resolve to the same topology.

## 1. The boot blocker (before the fix)

Command:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local up -d --build
```

Result: **FAILED to start.**

```
Error response from daemon: failed to set up container networking:
Bind for 0.0.0.0:6379 failed: port is already allocated
```

Root cause: the Redis service published host port `6379`, which was already in
use on the machine by an unrelated container. Redis failed to bind, its
dependents never started, and **zero** application containers came up.

## 2. After the fix — full boot

Change: infrastructure services (Postgres, Redis) now bind to `127.0.0.1` on
configurable host ports, defaulting Redis to `6380` to avoid the common
already-running-Redis clash. Only the gateway is published on all interfaces.

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local ps
```

Result: **11/11 services up, 10 healthy.**

| Service | Status |
| --- | --- |
| backend | Up (healthy) |
| frontend | Up (healthy) |
| nginx (gateway) | Up (healthy) |
| idp | Up (healthy) |
| postgres-automation | Up (healthy) |
| postgres-idp | Up (healthy) |
| redis | Up (healthy) |
| kafka | Up (healthy) |
| zookeeper | Up (healthy) |
| generic-auto | Up (healthy) |
| nginxconfigmanager | Up |

## 3. The readiness lie (before the fix)

`/readyz` was backed by `doctor.Diagnose`, which performs no I/O — it only checks
that configuration strings are non-empty. To demonstrate, all three data
dependencies were stopped and the endpoint was queried:

```
docker stop 018-hai-postgres-automation 018-hai-redis 018-hai-kafka
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:17070/readyz -w '%{http_code}'
```

Result: **HTTP 200, `"status":"ready"`, 14 ok / 0 fail** — with the database,
cache and event bus all stopped. Docker also reported the backend container
`healthy` throughout, because its healthcheck was a plain TCP socket probe.

## 4. Honest readiness (after the fix)

`/readyz` now runs live probes (authenticated Postgres ping, Redis PING over
RESP, Kafka client connect, LLM provider HTTP) and reports three states.

**All dependencies up:**

```
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:17070/readyz -w '%{http_code}'
```

```
HTTP 200  status=degraded  {ok:18, warn:1, fail:0}
  [OK  ] database.connection   reachable in 14ms
  [OK  ] redis.connection      reachable in 2ms
  [OK  ] kafka.connection      reachable in 3ms
  [WARN] llm.provider          no provider configured (OLLAMA_BASE_URL / FREE_CLOUD_OPENAI_BASE_URL unset)
```

`degraded`, not `ready`, is correct: no LLM provider is configured by default, so
generation genuinely is unavailable. Nothing is being hidden.

**Database stopped:**

```
docker stop 018-hai-postgres-automation
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:17070/readyz -w '%{http_code}'
```

```
HTTP 503  status=not_ready  {ok:17, warn:1, fail:1}
  [FAIL] database.connection   unreachable after 2ms: connect postgres-automation:5432/automation ...
```

The endpoint now fails, with HTTP 503, for the exact reason readiness exists.

## 5. Honest container healthcheck

The backend healthcheck now polls `/readyz` with `curl -f`, so it fails on the
503. Observed transitions:

- All dependencies up: backend reaches `healthy` ~32s after start.
- Database stopped: backend flips to `unhealthy` within ~40s (`retries: 3`).
- Database restarted: backend returns to `healthy` on the next probe (~8s).

Health probe log line while the DB was down:

```
exit=22 out=curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 503
```

## 6. Placeholder-secret detection

`.env.example` ships `RUN_MODE=production` with `change-this-*` placeholder
secrets. The doctor report now flags these instead of passing them:

- In production mode: `database.password`, `security.backendApiKey`,
  `jwtSecret`, and `memoryEncryptionKey` report **FAIL** when a value is a
  known placeholder, so `/readyz` is `not_ready` until real credentials and
  secrets are set.
- Outside production: the same placeholder values report **WARN** (visible,
  non-blocking). An empty database password is likewise permitted only for
  explicitly local trust-authentication setups.

`scripts/generate-secrets.sh` writes real `openssl rand -hex 32` values for the
backend signing/encryption keys, database password, and first-run owner password
that can be appended to `.env.local`.

## 7. Gateway routing drift

The nginx `/api/v1/*` allowlist had drifted from the backend's actual route
groups. Before the fix, three groups fell through to the IDP and returned 404
via the gateway: `agent-cycle`, `flags`, `system`.

```
# before: GET http://localhost:8088/api/v1/flags -> HTTP 404
# after:  GET http://localhost:8088/api/v1/flags -> HTTP 401 (reaches backend, gated by gateway login)
```

The 401 is correct for protected `/api/v1/*` engine routes: the route now maps
to the backend, which the gateway guards with its `auth_request` login check.
`/healthz` and `/readyz` are separate, intentionally public gateway probes.
Neither requires an IDP session. `/healthz` reports liveness; `/readyz` returns
the current readiness JSON with HTTP 200 or 503.

## 8. Two bugs the new probe surfaced immediately

Running the live probes for the first time exposed two latent
misconfigurations, both now fixed:

1. **Redis was unreachable from the backend.** Redis was attached only to
   `idp-network` while the backend runs on `automation-hub-network`; the probe
   reported `dial redis:6379: lookup redis ... no such host`. Redis is now also
   on `automation-hub-network`. (The backend does not yet *use* Redis — quota
   and rate-limit state is still in-process — but it can now reach it.)
2. **`JWT_SECRET` was never passed to the backend container.** It was defined for
   the IDP only, so the backend's identity middleware silently ran as a no-op.
   The secret (and `RUN_MODE`) are now passed to the backend.

## 9. Go build and tests

```
go build ./...      # clean
go vet ./...        # clean
go test ./...       # clean at the time of this dated verification
```

New tests: `internal/doctor/probe_test.go` (probe severity/criticality, timeout
bounding, order preservation, placeholder detection, the exact "valid config +
dead database" regression) and updated `internal/router/readiness_test.go` for
the tri-state semantics.

## 10. Frontend — System Status page

A new authenticated page at `/system-status` (nav: Control Center → System →
System Status) consumes `/readyz` and renders it: an overall banner
(ready/degraded/not ready), a recommended-next-actions list built from the
non-healthy checks, and per-subsystem cards that sort failures to the top. It
polls every 15s, and treats a 503 body as data rather than an error, so a
not-ready backend is shown rather than swallowed.

Build: the Angular image built cleanly; the page compiled into its own lazy
chunk (`pages-system-status-system-status-module`, 10.53 kB).

Verified in a real browser (Playwright, logged in as a locally-registered test
user, through the gateway on :8088):

- **All dependencies up** — banner "Degraded — serving with warnings", 18 ok / 1
  warn / 0 fail; the one warning is the absent LLM provider, with live probe
  timings shown (database 14 ms, redis 2 ms, kafka 11 ms).
  Screenshot: `docs/evidence/system-status-healthy.png`.
- **Database stopped** — the page (after its poll / a Refresh click) flips to a
  red "Not ready — a critical dependency is down", 17 ok / 1 warn / 1 fail; the
  Database card sorts to the top and shows the real driver error. Everything
  else stays green. Screenshot: `docs/evidence/system-status-db-down.png`.
- **Unauthenticated readiness probe** - `/readyz` through the gateway is
  intentionally public and returns the readiness payload and 200/503 semantics
  without an IDP session. Protected `/api/v1/*` engine routes still return 401
  when the session is absent.

Because readiness includes subsystem status, deployment operators must treat
network exposure of the public gateway as an explicit operational decision.
Authentication must not be added to `/readyz` without also updating container
health checks and monitoring clients that rely on a public probe.

Note: the browser check registered a throwaway local account
(`verify@local.test`) via the open `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint. It exists
only in the local Postgres volume.

---

## 11. Redis-backed rate limiting (quota across restarts)

The per-IP rate limiter kept its counters in a per-process map, so the limit
reset on every restart and could not hold across multiple backend instances.
Counters now live in Redis when `REDIS_ADDR` is set, with an in-process
fallback when it is not.

Fixing this surfaced another plumbing gap first: `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` was
defined in `.env` but never passed to the backend container, so the limiter
could not be enabled at all regardless of configuration. Now passed through.

Verified with `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=5`:

```
# backend log on startup:
ratelimit: using shared Redis store at redis:6379

# six requests in one window:
req 1..5 -> 200
req 6    -> 429   (Retry-After set)

# the counter is visibly in Redis:
redis-cli --scan --pattern 'ratelimit:*'
  ratelimit:172.23.0.1:29733334
```

Durability across a backend restart (the actual ask):

```
# before restart
ratelimit:172.23.0.1:29733334 = 100
docker restart 018-hai-backend
# after restart — same key, same value, untouched by the restart
ratelimit:172.23.0.1:29733334 = 100
```

And that enforcement reads the shared state rather than process memory: seeding
the counter in Redis to 99 caused the next request to be rejected immediately,
without the backend having counted it locally.

Default is unchanged (`RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=0`, disabled): 12 rapid requests
all return 200, so normal use is unaffected. Unit tests cover the limit
boundary, per-key isolation, and Redis-outage behavior using a deterministic
fake so they need no running Redis. When Redis is unreachable after startup,
the limiter now uses a bounded in-process fallback rather than silently
allowing unlimited requests. That fallback is per-process and resets on restart,
so Redis remains required for shared durable enforcement.

## 12. Honest connector status

The connector catalog reported all 9 connectors as `operational`, and the
dashboard showed "9 connectors operational". But only two make a live network
connection (GitHub REST, and the JSON feed); four are named after cloud services
(email, calendar, cloud-documents, project-board) while actually reading export
files from a local folder; one (`odoo-herp`) generates built-in domain models
with no live connection; the rest read local folders/exports. There is no OAuth
anywhere in the backend.

`AdapterStatus` was overloaded: it was both the UI label and the gate deciding
whether a source can be created (`service.go`). So the fix separates the two:

- Honest status values: `operational` (live remote), `local_only` (reads local
  files/folders), `modeled` (built-in models), `not_implemented` (contract only).
- A new `adapterIsUsable` helper gates source creation: everything except
  `not_implemented` can still be created, so the local-folder connectors that
  genuinely work keep working.

Verified:

```
# catalog now reports honestly:
github, json-feed          -> operational   (2)
email, calendar, cloud-documents,
project-board, local-folder,
whatsapp-export            -> local_only    (6)
odoo-herp                  -> modeled       (1)

# creating a local_only source still succeeds (function preserved):
POST /api/v1/sources {connectorKey: "email"} -> HTTP 201
```

The dashboard now reads **"2 live · 6 local · 1 modeled of 9 connectors"** instead
of "9 operational", and each connector in the picker is labelled honestly
("… — local files only", "… — live", "… — built-in model"). Screenshot:
`docs/evidence/connectors-honest-status.png`. The backend test suite passed at
the time of this dated verification, and the catalog test asserted the honest
statuses.

This is deliberately a downward change in the headline number — it removes an
overstatement, which is the point. No connector lost any real capability.

## 13. Authenticated and role-aware API boundary

The `rbac` package (roles owner/operator/viewer; permissions read/write/approve/
admin) was fully implemented and unit-tested but attached to **zero** routes —
`requirePermission` appeared 0 times in `routes.go`. And no role reached the
backend: the gateway forwarded only the cookie and shared key, so every caller
defaulted to `viewer`, which meant wiring write-gates naively would have 403'd
the entire UI.

The current contract does not trust a caller-supplied role header:

- Protected engine routes require the backend shared key and a verified identity
  token. The shared key alone is not user identity and receives HTTP 401.
- The gateway obtains a verified token from the IDP auth subrequest and forwards
  that token to the backend. The backend derives the subject and role from the
  signed token.
- Route-specific permission middleware then applies read, write, approve, or
  admin requirements. Sensitive owner-only routes retain explicit owner gates.
- A client-provided `X-HAI-Role` value is not an authentication mechanism.

The authenticated smoke tests exercise representative boundaries:

- shared key without identity token: HTTP 401 on protected routes;
- signed viewer identity: HTTP 403 on an admin route;
- signed owner identity: HTTP 200 on the same admin route.

These tests prove the local authentication and authorization contract. They do
not prove an external identity provider, OAuth consent, or production secret
rotation until those environment-specific steps are completed.

## 14. First real OAuth connector: Gmail (read-only)

The first connector that talks to a live external account instead of reading
local files. Built against the developer's own Google OAuth app.

Architecture:
- `internal/googleoauth`: the authorization-code flow (consent URL with
  `access_type=offline` for a refresh token, code exchange, refresh), an
  AES-256-GCM codec for tokens at rest, and a read-only Gmail REST client
  (metadata only). All unit-tested against mock servers.
- `internal/source/oauth.go`: HMAC-signed, stateless CSRF state; encrypted token
  storage (`SourceOAuthToken`); transparent token refresh; and a Gmail fetch
  wired into the sync dispatch.
- Routes: `sources/oauth/google/start` (authenticated) and `.../callback`. The
  gateway serves the callback publicly — Google has no HAI session — protected
  by the signed state, not the login.

Verified on the running stack:

```
# Not configured (GOOGLE_OAUTH_* empty) — honest, does not pretend to work:
gmail connector adapterStatus            -> not_implemented
GET sources/oauth/google/start           -> HTTP 400 "google oauth is not configured"

# Configured — the flow produces a real Google consent URL:
gmail connector adapterStatus            -> operational
GET sources/oauth/google/start           -> authorizeUrl =
    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?...
      client_id=<configured>
      scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
      access_type=offline
      redirect_uri=<gateway>/api/v1/sources/oauth/google/callback
      state=<hmac-signed>
```

This is verified up to the consent boundary. The final step — a real Google
account clicking "Allow", the callback storing tokens, and a sync pulling real
messages — requires the OAuth app's real credentials and a human consent, and is
performed with the operator during the live/remote session. It is deliberately
not claimed as done here.

## 15. Framework Registry and durable task state (2026-07-30 addendum)

This section describes the current branch implementation boundary. It is
separate from the dated 2026-07-14 host evidence above.

### Present in the repository

- A code-owned Framework Registry catalog with exactly 55 version `1.0.0`
  records: 50 `active`, five `experimental`, and zero `deprecated`.
- A deterministic `selector-v5` contract with required overlays, risk-ceiling
  enforcement, conflict handling, a 16-framework limit, authority ceilings, and evidence/completion
  requirements.
- A durable operating contract containing multi-domain classification,
  needs-state and capacity constraints, fresh verified agent cards, explicit
  unassigned roles, complete identity/capability/access/health/revocation
  metadata, zero-spend delegation contracts, typed replay-resistant
  communication, coordination, exact 0-10 per-action autonomy, stop
  conditions, outcome monitoring, and eight Chief-of-Staff answers.
- Owner-scoped preferences. `disabled` is an effective preference, not a catalog
  lifecycle status; protected overlays reject disable attempts.
- Owner-scoped Constitution drafts and activation. Activation requires the exact
  case- and whitespace-sensitive phrase `ACTIVATE CONSTITUTION` and a redacted
  approval note of at least 10 characters.
- Restrictive typed Constitution rules for deny-capability, require-approval,
  and authority-ceiling. Ordinary prose is versioned context, not executable
  authority, and no typed rule can grant capability.
- Reproducibility metadata containing catalog, selector, effective-preference,
  and Constitution versions/digests plus selected framework versions and exact
  Constitution source.
- Authenticated registry API routes and Angular `/framework-registry` UI.
  Viewers read, operators read and request selections, and owners administer
  preferences and Constitution lifecycle.
- Pre-phase migrations `0003_framework_registry`,
  `0004_task_state_storage`, and `0005_framework_operating_contract`.
- Owner-scoped task completion logs, review items, and immutable decisions.
  Approved execution is bound to the stored owner, request digest, review
  revision, task/project/automation context, and `task-review:<id>` source.
- HTTP task-history/review reads return an error when the durable repository
  fails instead of showing an empty ledger.

These are implementation statements, not live-provider or production-readiness
statements.

### Verification boundary for this addendum

The repository contains focused unit, route, frontend, in-memory repository, and
PostgreSQL integration tests for these contracts. CI is configured to run
Framework Registry and task-state database tests in isolated PostgreSQL
databases and to exercise signed-session and Windows shell contracts.

On 2026-07-30, a fresh local verification pass completed the backend unit
suite, vet, and build; the IDP unit suite, vet, and build; the frontend's 126
headless unit tests and production build; the Python CI, authentication, and
gateway contract suites; Compose configuration validation; and Bash syntax
checks for the smoke scripts. All three Go modules, container builders, and CI
runners are pinned to the same Go 1.25.12 toolchain by an executable CI
contract test. Refreshed `govulncheck` v1.6.0 scans report 0 vulnerabilities
affecting backend, IDP, or nginx configuration manager code; all three pinned
scans are blocking CI gates. The nginx manager no longer imports the Docker SDK
or receives a Docker-socket mount.

This is source and local-build evidence, not a production deployment receipt.
PostgreSQL integration jobs, race tests, authenticated stack smoke, real
connected accounts, and target-machine acceptance remain release gates. Treat
the next completed CI run and the target-machine acceptance run as the
authoritative evidence for those environments.

That dated pass also ran the production-dependency frontend audit and found 12
high and 1 moderate advisory in the Angular 16 dependency family. The finding
was subsequently superseded by the coordinated 2026-08-09 Angular 22 migration:
the full audit now reports 3 moderate development-tool findings and 0
high/critical, and `npm audit --audit-level=high` is blocking. See
`docs/dependency-vulnerabilities.md` for the accepted scope and review deadline.

### 2026-08-09 live Windows regression acceptance

The current Angular 22 frontend, IDP, and task-review backend were rebuilt and
deployed into the retained local Windows Compose stack. The full backend and
IDP Go suites passed, all 379 frontend tests passed under Node 22.22.3, the
production frontend build passed, and all 17 executable CI contract tests
passed. An authenticated browser run against `http://localhost` verified login,
the shared shell, Basic-to-Advanced disclosure, mobile overflow, and meaningful
content on Control Center, Pursuits, Workflow Engine, Task Blueprint, Connected
Sources, Framework Registry, Runtime Control, and System Status. The browser
reported no console or HTTP failures.

This pass also repaired two live defects rather than masking them: the pending
task review queue no longer fails because of unreadable resolved history, and
the signed-out session probe now returns an explicit unauthenticated status
without producing a normal 401 console error. Historical task digests are
accepted only when they exactly match the legacy v1 algorithm and carry none of
the newer mandate or coordination provenance, preserving the fail-closed trust
boundary.

The repository now also contains a disabled-by-default, digest-pinned ngrok
profile and a Windows public-exposure preflight. Static CI contracts, Compose
validation, ngrok v3 configuration validation, shell syntax, and positive and
negative fail-closed gate cases pass. No live ngrok token or public endpoint was
used in this verification, so external tunnel and callback behavior remains a
target-environment acceptance gate rather than a readiness claim.

### Known recovery and deployment gaps

- Automation approval-proof replay state is owner-scoped and durable in the
  append-only PostgreSQL consumption ledger. Its signing key is deployment
  configuration and must remain consistent across backend instances.
- A durable task review can remain `approved` if the backend stops after the
  decision is committed but before the execution outcome is committed.
- There is no automatic review-reconciliation worker and no public recovery
  endpoint for that indeterminate state. Operators must inspect external
  effects and audit evidence before any retry.
- PostgreSQL persistence and immutable constraints do not prove exactly-once
  external side effects.
- Migration files exist, but a clean-clone migration/rollback/restore exercise
  on the target Windows host remains required.
- A two-real-account owner-isolation browser exercise remains required.
- Named implementation candidates in the 55-record catalog are not installed
  or trusted merely because the catalog references them.
- Agent cards prove only the freshness and provenance supplied by a trusted
  runtime health source. Missing specialists remain `required_unassigned`;
  HAI does not invent live workers from catalog role names.
- Typed communication validates idempotency, expiry, confidentiality,
  provenance, payload digest, and optional signature-digest shape, but a
  distributed A2A transport, cryptographic signature authority, live consensus
  service, and durable standing-mandate workflow are not claimed.
- Real LLM providers, connected accounts, and external agent runtimes require
  their own configuration, authorization, bounded probe, approved task, audit,
  and verification evidence.

## What is NOT claimed here

- A real Gmail OAuth connector now exists and is verified to the consent
  boundary (section 14); the live pull of real mail awaits real credentials and
  consent. This historical record does not assert the current readiness of
  other connectors; use the current connector catalog and its live health
  checks for that decision.
- This verification did not exercise provider-backed LLM generation, paid
  provider billing, or external quota accounting. The local smoke suites must
  not be presented as evidence for those external behaviors.
- The signed-JWT smoke fixtures prove route enforcement, not production identity
  provisioning. Production readiness still requires configured IDP secrets,
  real sessions, and operator-owned external authorization.
- The Framework Registry does not prove that all named agent frameworks,
  workflow platforms, memory stores, policy engines, or evaluation products
  power HAI.
- Durable approval records do not prove crash-safe or exactly-once external
  execution.

These are called out honestly rather than presented as done.
