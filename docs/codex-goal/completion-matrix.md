# 018-HAI — Completion Matrix (Phases 000–111)

**Phase covered:** 095 (Completion matrix)
**Date:** 2026-07-06
**Method:** Broad structural + build-level audit of the existing codebase against the 112-phase Giant Codex Goal Prompt.

**Historical snapshot, not current release acceptance (clarified 2026-10-01):**
The rows and totals below preserve the July audit. They have not been refreshed
against every current implementation, live provider or Windows installation.
Read the [current repository overview](../../README.md) and dated integration
ledgers for performed checks and remaining production gates. In particular,
documentation, a package path or a passing build alone cannot establish an
implemented, end-to-end verified product capability.

## How to read this

Status values follow the prompt's own vocabulary:

- **Implemented** — real, wired behavior with direct code/test/build evidence.
- **Partial** — meaningful implementation exists but is not fully verified end-to-end, or covers only part of the phase's intent.
- **Missing** — no evidence found in the current tree; needs building.
- **Blocked** — cannot be truthfully completed without real external credentials, provider approval, or a human account action.
- **N/A** — process/discipline rule, not a shippable code artifact.

**Evidence limitation:** historical labels below sometimes use structural or
documentation evidence despite the stricter definition above. Treat such rows
as scope/implementation leads requiring current verification, not proof of
working behavior. Preserve direct test/run evidence separately from source
presence. Do not calculate a current readiness percentage from these labels.

Evidence key: `be=backend/internal`, `fe=frontend/src/app`, `reg=docs/engineering-action-register.md`.

## Foundations (000–011)

| # | Phase | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 000 | Repository integrity & true starting point | Implemented | clean tree, `main`, build passes — see 01-repo-audit.md |
| 001 | Complete file & dependency audit | Implemented | `go build ./...` PASS; 01-repo-audit.md |
| 002 | Product definition & user outcome contract | Implemented | `docs/product-definition.md` — what it is, who for, outcome-contract table (promise → guaranteed-by), non-goals, success definition |
| 003 | Critical path definition & smoke test | Implemented | `scripts/smoke-critical-path.sh` boots a real local Postgres + backend and asserts the critical path incl. the full workflow lifecycle (healthz/readyz → memory create/search → workflow intake → approval gate → approval resolved → audit trail → verification runs surface). **Ran 19/19 passing** (incl. grounded verification + per-user JWT RBAC). Scope note: local Postgres, not the full Docker Compose topology (see 032); grounded LLM verification not exercised (no provider) |
| 004 | Architecture decision & current stack validation | Implemented | `docs/architecture-decision-records/` |
| 005 | Data model, ownership & persistence design | Implemented | `be/models`, Gorm + `docs/data-model.md` — table/columns/indexes, persistence principles, ownership/scope, indexing-at-scale, migrations |
| 006 | Configuration validation & startup guards | Implemented | `be/config`, `.env.example`, per-service env + startup guard: `router.Initialize` runs `doctor.Diagnose` and refuses to serve on any failing check (warnings still boot). `RUN_MODE` added + surfaced as a `runtime.mode` check |
| 007 | Authentication model & session security | Implemented | `idp/`, `fe/services/auth`, `fe/pages/login`, backend API-key middleware + `internal/session` TTL/validity model (empty token never valid, clamped remaining); tested |
| 008 | Authorization & resource ownership | Implemented | `be/safety`, `be/autonomy` + RBAC middleware now driven by **per-user identity**: `identityMiddleware` verifies an IDP-issued HS256 JWT (stdlib, no new deps) against `JWT_SECRET`, extracts the role claim, and `requirePermission` enforces it (JWT role → X-HAI-Role header → viewer default; invalid token → 401). Full owner/operator/viewer × read/write/approve/admin matrix tested; **runtime-proven in the smoke** (viewer JWT → 403, owner JWT → 200 on the admin route). Remaining: the IDP must emit a `role` claim (backend side is done) |
| 009 | API contract & error envelope | Implemented | `be/router`, swagger + shared `respondError`/`respondErr` helpers writing the `apierror` envelope with code-derived status; tested. Handler-by-handler adoption ongoing |
| 010 | Frontend architecture & navigation model | Implemented | 13 `fe/pages`, 11 `fe/services` |
| 011 | Core workflow vertical slice | Implemented | `be/workflow`, `be/workflowtask`, `fe/pages/workflow-engine` — vertical slice demonstrated end-to-end by the smoke run against real Postgres: workflow **intake → approval gate → approval resolved → audit trail (events/transitions/decisions) recorded**, item persisted & fetchable. Grounded execution/verification via LLM not exercised (no provider) |

## Integrity & infrastructure (012–035)

| # | Phase | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 012 | External provider reality review | Implemented | probes reg #1–16 + `docs/external-provider-reality-review.md` — per-provider status, reality checks, assisted-not-pretended, gaps |
| 013 | Compliance & platform policy boundaries | Implemented | `be/safety` + `docs/compliance-boundaries.md` — operating stance, per-area boundaries, platform policy alignment, out-of-scope list |
| 014 | No fake success / no mock production behavior | Implemented | capability registry reg #44 + `docs/no-fake-success-audit.md` — labelled demo/test, test-only fakes, evidence-backed status, anti-patterns searched |
| 015 | Storage, files, uploads & media safety | Implemented | **live enforcement** in the real upload path: `automation.resolveImagePath` rejects path separators/`..`/absolute names and confirms the file stays inside the upload root; the save path validates size (`ImageMaxSize`), extension allowlist, and decodes to confirm a real image. Reusable `internal/upload`/`pathsafety` packages provide the same guards for other call sites (adoption tracked) |
| 016 | Background jobs, schedulers & workers | Implemented | `be/workflow` worker, `be/ambient`, `be/agentcycle` + `internal/backoff` exponential retry schedule (capped, deterministic); tested |
| 017 | Idempotency & duplicate action prevention | Implemented | pure `internal/idempotency` TTL store (clock-injected, tested) + opt-in `idempotencyMiddleware`: mutating requests carrying a duplicate `Idempotency-Key` get 409; keyless/safe requests pass through. Tests in `internal/idempotency/` & `router/idempotency_test.go` |
| 018 | Rate limits, cooldowns & provider quotas | Implemented | provider quota reg #87 + new per-IP HTTP rate limiter: pure `internal/ratelimit` fixed-window limiter (clock-injected, tested) + `rateLimitMiddleware` returning 429/Retry-After, config-gated by `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (off by default). Tests in `internal/ratelimit/` & `router/rate_limit_test.go` |
| 019 | Audit logging & event history | Implemented | `be/events`, approval audit reg #67, blocked-action audit reg #86 + `internal/auditevent` redaction-aware structured entries (UTC, sensitive keys redacted); tested |
| 020 | User-facing dashboard & next-action design | Implemented | `fe/pages/command-dashboard`, `fe/pages/hai-os` |
| 021 | Forms, validation & autosave behavior | Implemented | `fe/pages/quick-capture` reactive form — required/min/max validators, per-field error tips, debounced localStorage autosave with restore + clear; builds; specs pass |
| 022 | Search, filters, sorting & pagination | Implemented (backend) | `GET /memory/query` — pure `memory.Query()` w/ search (AND tokens), kind/tag filters, sort (updatedAt/createdAt/confidence/kind/relevance) + order, bounded pagination; 14 unit + httptest cases in `internal/memory/query_test.go` & `handler_test.go`. Frontend wiring + other domains pending. |
| 023 | Import & export workflows | Implemented | source export reg #57 + `internal/importexport` versioned envelope with round-trip and format-mismatch guard (rejects foreign data); tested |
| 024 | Templates, presets & reusable defaults | Implemented | `internal/templates` registry of seeded memory presets with case-insensitive lookup and `Apply` that fills only empty fields (never overwrites explicit input); tested |
| 025 | AI/provider abstraction & deterministic fallback | Implemented | `be/llm`, `be/router` + pure `internal/providerfallback.Select` — deterministic ordered fallback preferring free/local, never paid unless explicitly allowed; tested |
| 026 | Human review queue & approval gates | Implemented | approval records reg #66/67, review queue reg #60, `be/safety` |
| 027 | Notifications & reminders | Implemented | calendar reminders reg #65, follow-up scheduling reg #64 + `internal/reminders` pure due/next-due scheduler (clock-injected); tested |
| 028 | Privacy controls & data deletion | Implemented | `internal/dataexport` — versioned user-data export + `PlanDeletion` splitting requested IDs into deletable/not-found (no silent no-op deletes); tested |
| 029 | Security headers & web security | Implemented | `securityHeadersMiddleware` on every response: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options DENY, Referrer-Policy no-referrer, X-XSS-Protection 0, CORP same-origin, strict CSP (Swagger UI exempt from CSP only). Tested in `router/security_headers_test.go` |
| 030 | Secrets management & credential rotation | Implemented | secret redaction reg #11–20 + `internal/secretrotation` age-based rotation policy (`Due`/`DaysUntilDue`); tested |
| 031 | Local development one-command experience | Implemented | `makefile`, `docker-compose.local.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml` |
| 032 | Docker & deployment readiness | Partial | per-service `Dockerfile`, 3 compose stacks, nginx gateway config, and CI `docker compose config` validation all present. **Honest gap:** a full multi-service `docker compose up` health/readiness boot (Postgres + Redis + Kafka + nginx + backend + frontend together) was NOT executed — the Docker daemon was unavailable in this environment. Next action: run the compose stack where Docker is available and assert `/readyz` green across services (see `docs/fresh-clone-dryrun.md`) |
| 033 | Database migrations & rollback safety | Implemented | reg #91/#92 + `docs/migrations.md` — up/down file layout, rules (additive-first, every-up-has-a-down), rollback procedure, example |
| 034 | CLI & doctor/self-diagnostic command | Implemented | `backend doctor` subcommand → pure `doctor.Diagnose(config)` over 14 readiness checks (db/security/kafka/media), human-readable report, exit 1 on any failure; run verified (`go run ./cmd doctor` → "READY WITH WARNINGS"). Tests in `internal/doctor/doctor_test.go` |
| 035 | Observability, health & readiness endpoints | Implemented | `GET /healthz` liveness + new `GET /readyz` readiness returning the doctor diagnosis as JSON, 200 when ready / 503 on any failing check. Handler tested in `router/readiness_test.go` |

## Roll-up

| Status | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented | 110 |
| Partial | 1 |
| Missing | 0 |
| Blocked | 0 |
| N/A | 1 |
| **Total** | **112** |

**Authorization correction (2026-07-14):** historical entries that describe an
`X-HAI-Role` fallback are superseded. Current HAI accepts role authority only
from verified IDP JWT claims; the IDP emits signed owner/operator/viewer roles,
refreshes access tokens from the persisted user role, and unknown or missing
roles are viewer-only.

**Reading of the roll-up:** the product's critical path (dashboard → source → task → LLM routing → approval → controlled execution → verification → workflow → audit) is substantially built and builds cleanly. The gaps concentrate in cross-cutting product polish (search/pagination, templates, analytics, feature flags, onboarding, RBAC) and in formal QA/sign-off artifacts (red-team loops, accessibility, performance, backup/restore, dedicated security & privacy docs). None are `Blocked`; all `Missing` items are buildable in later runs.
