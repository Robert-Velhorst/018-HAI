# Child-agent integration ledger

This ledger preserves the operational result of the large HAI child-agent run
before any local transcript cleanup. It is evidence about integration state, not
permission to delete session data.

The separately audited 2026-07-30 archive and its cleanup-readiness decision are
recorded in `docs/child-agent-archive-2026-07-30/cleanup-readiness.md`; do not
mix its file counts or retention decisions with the August cohort below.

## Audited snapshot

Snapshot date: 2026-08-08

- Pinned HAI root session: `019e7acc-44f2-7c90-a04e-253f6d43df28`.
- August 4-5 contains 97 child transcripts. Applying the conservative rule that
  the latest terminal event wins produces 88 completed, three aborted, and six
  without a terminal marker. The completed set occupies exactly 238,891,183,316
  bytes: 222.485 GiB or 238.891 decimal GB.
- Across all audited August dates, 114 HAI child transcripts were found: 104
  completed, three aborted, and seven without a terminal marker. The completed
  set occupies exactly 263,110,870,955 allocated bytes: 245.041 GiB or 263.111
  decimal GB.
- Forty-seven completed August 4-5 children reported implementation work. The
  181 genuine repository paths declared by those reports were present in the
  shared worktree at audit time.
- Presence is not release proof. At audit time `main` and `origin/main` both
  pointed to `37edf880e9252bf34635ef9c35b173e32b89ced0`, while the shared
  worktree contained 273 modified and 362 untracked status entries with nothing
  staged.

## Results preserved in the worktree

The completed implementation sequence is represented by source, migrations,
tests, and the truthfulness matrices in this repository. Its major themes are:

1. Durable approval and single-use execution authorization.
2. Governed contact review and owner-scoped life context.
3. Selector-v5 risk, autonomy, and approval ceiling enforcement.
4. Typed framework evidence before authorization and after execution.
5. Temporal claim assessment with source and contradiction handling.
6. Pursuit portfolio planning, allocation, proposal, decision, authorization,
   workflow creation, dispatch, settlement, and controlled learning.
7. Advisory ambient outcome monitoring and immutable composition provenance.
8. Immutable plan graphs and exact workflow and pursuit coordination binding.
9. Governed internal reminder delivery with append-only receipts and no external
   messaging authority.
10. Runtime, provider, and external-effect boundaries that continue to fail
    closed when live acceptance evidence is absent.

The current implementation and remaining external acceptance boundaries are
tracked in `docs/completion-matrix.md`,
`docs/framework-operating-contract-matrix.md`, and
`docs/requirements-traceability.md`.

## Preserved transcript outputs

The provisional audit has been replaced by three generated, reviewable
artifacts:

- `docs/child-agent-transcript-manifest.csv` has one row per audited transcript,
  including terminal state, work kind, exact logical and allocated bytes,
  terminal-report SHA-256, and disposition.
- `docs/child-agent-final-reports.md` preserves the complete terminal report for
  every completed child. Potential credential-shaped values are redacted, while
  the manifest stores the SHA-256 of the original report text.
- `docs/child-agent-transcript-summary.json` records aggregate counts and exact
  byte totals.

The artifacts are reproducible with
`scripts/audit-child-agent-transcripts.ps1`. The script reads session metadata
and bounded transcript tails; it cannot delete, move, truncate, compress, or
archive session files.

## Transcripts that must be retained

Aborted children:

- `019fd061-d940-7c53-b9ce-a5f94cba4f37`
- `019fd062-611f-7fa1-a245-ceed50c175d2`
- `019fd062-e4b9-7e01-b26c-757eb8dfdbe3`

Children without a terminal marker:

- `019fd0dc-4212-7800-8448-62a9fc8ca673`
- `019fd0de-103a-7092-8771-9b1ae1c83fd6`
- `019fd0df-32c2-79b0-aae3-a9d3c566575b`
- `019fd0e0-43a3-76e0-abf3-4a1490e05cc9`
- `019fd0e0-64ff-7cf0-915c-1d101cbaeeb2`
- `019fd0e0-89cd-71c1-89ca-fa6ce900c8ac`
- `019fded0-b7ee-7490-9573-596d47cf4e36` (current August 8 child)

These ten retained transcripts occupy exactly 21,882,851,783 allocated bytes:
20.380 GiB or 21.883 decimal GB. This includes the current August 8 child.

The two completed children that stopped with partial work and the read-only
whole-system synthesis no longer require their multi-gigabyte transcripts for
result preservation. Their terminal reports are in
`docs/child-agent-final-reports.md`, and their applicable source work is covered
by the verified repository checkpoint. They therefore follow the same cleanup
disposition as other completed children.

## Cleanup gate

Completed transcripts become cleanup candidates only after all
of the following are true:

1. The shared worktree has a named Git checkpoint containing the intended HAI
   source, migrations, tests, and this ledger.
2. Backend, IDP, frontend, and Compose validation results are recorded against
   that checkpoint.
3. Audit-only findings that are not represented in the matrices are distilled
   before their transcripts are removed.
4. Aborted, non-terminal, and current children remain untouched. Completed
   partial-work reports must be preserved before their transcripts qualify.
5. Local databases, source attachments, worktrees, credentials, Playwright
   diagnostics, and external-provider evidence are excluded from transcript
   cleanup.

No transcript deletion, movement, truncation, compression, or archival was
performed while producing this ledger.

## Cleanup disposition

All five cleanup gates are now represented in committed or generated evidence:

1. The integrated source checkpoint exists and is pushed.
2. Backend, IDP, frontend, build, and Compose validation evidence is recorded.
3. Every completed child's terminal report is preserved with its original-text
   SHA-256, including audit-only findings and partial-work reports.
4. Every aborted, nonterminal, and current child is explicitly marked `retain`
   in the manifest.
5. The manifest contains only HAI child transcript JSONL files under the audited
   August session tree. Databases, attachments, worktrees, credentials,
   diagnostics, and provider evidence are not cleanup candidates.

After this ledger and its generated artifacts are committed and pushed, the 104
manifest rows marked `candidate_after_ledger_commit` can become an exact cleanup
allowlist. Deleting only those paths would reclaim 245.041 GiB (263.111 decimal
GB) while preserving the ten protected transcripts and all source/worktree
data. Cleanup remains a separate explicit operation; this ledger does not
authorize or perform it.

The manifest, preserved terminal reports, reproducible audit script, and this
ledger were committed and pushed on `main` as
`7f76cd6671d498edfa8014996e4cab3682a9972c`. The 104 completed rows therefore
satisfy the `candidate_after_ledger_commit` condition.

## Cleanup execution

On 2026-08-09, the 104 exact manifest paths marked
`candidate_after_ledger_commit` were deleted in a separate, explicitly
authorized operation. Preflight required every file to remain under the audited
session root, match its recorded size, have terminal status `completed`, have a
preserved final report, and have no writer-lock reference.

Post-delete verification found zero candidate files, all ten retained files at
their recorded sizes, the pinned parent task still present, and exactly ten HAI
child transcripts remaining in the audited August tree. The operation reclaimed
263,111,102,464 bytes according to the filesystem. Full evidence is recorded in
`docs/child-agent-transcript-cleanup-receipt.md`.

## Verified checkpoint

The integrated source was checkpointed on `main` as commit
`4dc725628a717ece36ca22e246ba5a42c2fd2fcf` on 2026-08-08. The commit contains
785 source and documentation files and was pushed to the canonical
`Robert-Velhorst/018-HAI` repository.

Validation completed before the checkpoint:

- Backend: `go test ./...` passed with Go 1.25.12 in the documented container.
- IDP: `go test ./...` passed with Go 1.25.12 in the documented container.
- Backend and IDP production builds passed.
- Frontend: 372 ChromeHeadless unit tests passed.
- Frontend production build passed. Existing bundle-budget warnings remain and
  are not represented as failures.
- `docker compose --env-file .env.example -f docker-compose.local.yml config
  --quiet` passed.
- `git diff --cached --check` passed after three migration EOF whitespace fixes.
- A staged credential-pattern scan found only intentional fake values in
  redaction and security tests.

After the push, local `main` and `origin/main` both resolved to the checkpoint
commit and the worktree was clean. This satisfies cleanup gates 1 and 2. The
generated manifest and terminal-report archive satisfy gates 3 through 5 for
the audited allowlist; those gates remain mandatory for every future batch.
